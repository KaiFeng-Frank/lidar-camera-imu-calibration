# LiDAR-Camera-IMU Calibration

**LiDAR-Camera-IMU Calibration is an open, one-stop multi-sensor calibration
and deployment workbench for cameras, IMUs, LiDARs and their cross-sensor
transforms. The documented D435i/MID-360S rig includes camera calibration,
MID-360S IMU calibration, LiDAR–camera and LiDAR–IMU geometry, cross-device time
alignment, scan deskew, native MID-360S viewing, one-canvas point-cloud fusion,
and a ROS 2 calibrated-IMU runtime.**

Calibration's worst failure mode is **looking beautiful while being consistently wrong**.
This workbench pairs fitted metrics with physical references, repeated captures
and device/mount identity, then publishes the applicable evidence tier beside
the result. The same facts feed the CLI, report, GUI and live fused viewer.

## Delivered scope

**D435i calibration**: RGB intrinsics → stereo IR → RGB↔IR extrinsics →
depth noise model → camera-IMU → accelerometer intrinsics → thermal drift
model, together with capture/calibration tools, the GUI, and field-tested
engineering notes.

**Declarative verdict layer**: 26 rules feed the CLI, `REPORT.md`, and GUI cards
through one engine, so supporting another device means adding rules rather than
forking verdict code.

**D435i/MID-360S rig**: the viewer renders arbitrary ROS 2
`sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2` streams and Livox `CustomMsg`; the direct
LiDAR–camera workflow covers capture through import; and live D435i/MID-360S
clouds share one camera-frame canvas. The documented mount has four bound
operational MID-360S results: its IMU calibration, five-scene LiDAR–camera
extrinsic, LiDAR–IMU geometry, and LiDAR–D435i constant time offset. Per-point
`offset_time` and the 200 Hz built-in gyro drive scan-end rotational deskew
with the calibrated IMU lever arm.

The rig uses an Intel RealSense D435i (fw 5.12.7.100, USB 3.2) and a DFOPTIX
`Tag6-320-35.2mm` rigid AprilGrid. The manufactured target rules out print
scaling as an error source. `tagSpacing = 0.3` was confirmed four independent
ways: ruler-measured 10.6 mm gap, part number, Kalibr default, and a
reprojection-error sweep with a clear minimum at 0.30.

## End-to-end MID-360S IMU pipeline and ROS 2 deployment

The fail-closed entry point covers identity preflight, automatic stable-pose
capture (or existing rosbag2/NPZ inputs), explicit `g × 9.80665` conversion,
calibration, independent holdout/observability gates, formal-result promotion,
and the viewer-registry check:

```bash
# Live: automatically collect 12 fit + 3 holdout orientations from /livox/imu.
./calibrate_mid360s_imu.sh --project-root /path/to/your_rig_workspace

# Deterministically replay this documented rig's accepted result.
./calibrate_mid360s_imu.sh --verify-existing --inputs \
  data/mid360s_imu_intrinsic_20260901_run1 \
  data/mid360s_imu_intrinsic_20260901_run2 \
  data/mid360s_imu_intrinsic_20260901_run3
```

The repository is also an installable ROS 2 package. With ROS 2 Jazzy sourced:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select rgbd_fullcalib
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch rgbd_fullcalib mid360s_imu_calibration.launch.py \
  project_root:=/absolute/path/to/artifact-root \
  config_file:=/absolute/path/to/mid360s_imu_calibration.yaml
ros2 launch rgbd_fullcalib mid360s_imu_runtime.launch.py \
  project_root:=/absolute/path/to/artifact-root \
  config_file:=/absolute/path/to/mid360s_imu_calibration.yaml
```

The runtime node subscribes to raw `/livox/imu`, applies the accepted
accelerometer bias/scale/non-orthogonality and gyro static bias, and publishes
calibrated SI measurements on `/livox/imu_calibrated`. Topics, frames, identity,
paths, and outputs are ROS parameters in
[`config/mid360s_imu_calibration.yaml`](config/mid360s_imu_calibration.yaml).

The exact printable bracket used by the documented rig is included as a
two-part, millimetre-unit [3MF package](hardware/MID360S_D435i_RK3588S_BATTERY_REV6_A1_PLA_4W15.3mf)
with [geometry/orientation notes](hardware/README.md). ROS installation places
it under `share/rgbd_fullcalib/hardware`.

The GUI and result API expose **11 current-rig results** and a separate
**7-item calibration reference** catalog for other devices and deployment
conditions.

Machine-readable outputs live in [`data/*.yaml`](data) and [`results/*.json`](results),
including [`results/mid360s_d435i_timesync.json`](results/mid360s_d435i_timesync.json),
[`results/mid360s_imu.json`](results/mid360s_imu.json),
[`results/mid360s_lidar_imu.json`](results/mid360s_lidar_imu.json), and
[`results/mid360s_deskew_validation.json`](results/mid360s_deskew_validation.json);
plots live in [`results/*.png`](results).

The real-scan deskew validation had 100% valid point offsets. A same-point
ablation reduced P95 from 20.21 to 19.48 mm when the calibrated lever-arm
component was enabled (about 3.6% by group median; paired median about 2.8%).

The MID-360S IMU result also records gyro bias
`[−0.006402,+0.000822,−0.008318] rad/s` and per-axis 0.496 s short-window
white-noise density at 196.156 Hz: accel
`[0.004974,0.005405,0.006853] m/s²/√Hz`, gyro
`[0.001421,0.001216,0.001749] rad/s/√Hz`. The deployed correction uses the
measured accelerometer model and gyro static bias.

The LiDAR–camera transform belongs to the documented rigid installation;
another rig or a remount gets its own transform through the same workflow.

## Validated applicability

Every published result is tied to its sensor and rigid-mount identity. The
runtime applies only parameters that passed observability, repeatability, and
holdout checks; detailed controlled studies and deployment decisions are
preserved in [CALIBRATION.md](CALIBRATION.md).

## Downstream check: FAST-LIVO2 real-time mapping

![FAST-LIVO2 mapping with this repo's calibration, rendered from the live recording](results/fastlivo2_mapping_mid360s_d435i.gif)

The extrinsics, time offset and intrinsics published here were consumed **unchanged** by
[FAST-LIVO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST-LIVO2) on the same mounted rig (2026-09-19):
`T_camera_lidar` → `Rcl/Pcl`, `T_lidar_imu` → `extrinsic_T/R`, the LiDAR→depth time offset
inverted to `img_time_offset = +5.989 ms`, and the factory 1280×720 RGB intrinsics.
A 103 s hand-held loop (27.0 m path, ~2×3 m room) stayed within 2.1 m of its start, with a median
LIO inlier ratio of 86 % and median point-to-plane residual of 0.019 m. Three offline replays of the
same recording (1×, 3×, and 1× with rviz + recording running) reproduced the trajectory to within 0.15 m.
Evidence and every consumed field: [`results/fastlivo2_downstream_validation.json`](results/fastlivo2_downstream_validation.json).
This is a functional check on the recorded rig and mount session, not an independent accuracy tier.

## Downstream check 2: Coco-LIC on the same recording

![Coco-LIC mapping with this repo's calibration, same recording as FAST-LIVO2, replayed offline](results/cocolic_mapping_mid360s_d435i.gif)

The same calibration was then consumed by a second, structurally different estimator:
[Coco-LIC](https://github.com/APRIL-ZJU/Coco-LIC) (continuous-time B-spline LiDAR-inertial-camera odometry, run through
its [ROS 2 Jazzy port](https://github.com/KaiFeng-Frank/Coco-LIC-ROS2-Jazzy)) on the identical 105 s recording
(`sha256 22c204e5…`, converted to rosbag2). Coco-LIC parameterises camera→IMU directly, so `T_camera_lidar · T_lidar_imu`
was composed from the two published matrices; `img_time_offset` and the 1280×720 intrinsics are the same numbers FAST-LIVO2 used.
Both estimators close the loop 1.45–1.46 m from the start. Associating their poses in time (1370 of 1376, ≤ 20 ms) and
aligning only yaw + translation (the two world frames differ), the positions agree to an RMSE of 0.15 m (median 0.09 m);
the largest gap, 0.76 m, sits in one 10 s stretch next to a window. LiDAR-inertial-only Coco-LIC lands at 0.135 m RMSE.
There is no ground truth, so these are cross-consistency numbers, not accuracy. Re-projecting the camera images onto
Coco-LIC's own map with the composed extrinsic colours 95 % of its 2.25 M points without visible smearing across geometry.
Evidence: [`results/cocolic_downstream_validation.json`](results/cocolic_downstream_validation.json).

## Engineering notes

Fifteen+ field-tested implementation notes are preserved in
[CALIBRATION.md](CALIBRATION.md) (Chinese, with universal code snippets and
numbers). Every entry below is resolved in the shipped tooling. Highlights:

| # | Engineering case | Applied solution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cv2.aruco` default adaptive-threshold windows (3…23 step 10) | at ~6 px/tag-cell in IR you detect 2/36 tags; use 3…15 step 2 → 29/36 |
| 2 | Both RealSense sensors report `supports(exposure)` | a loop "find the sensor" sets exposure on **RGB**, your IR stays untouched — *if a knob changes nothing, the knob isn't connected* |
| 3 | Overexposure kills tag detection at any distance | lock short exposure, watch the histogram, not the pretty image |
| 4 | Working-distance window = f(board size, focal, resolution) | at 848×480 the "board fits" and "tags big enough" windows barely overlap — switch resolution, don't fight distance |
| 5 | RealSense options are device-persistent | yesterday's experiment silently poisons today's capture |
| 6 | Kalibr's silent-NaN focal init | non-interactive runs read an empty focal answer, set fx≈2.6e-315, then print "Calibration complete" — feed initials via stdin (see `calibrate_cam.sh`) |
| 7 | Kalibr's pose spline is hard-coded at 100 knots/s | jerky handheld motion crashes the solver — move slower, not smoother |
| 8 | RGB and IR have no hardware sync | during motion a ~44 ms offset gets absorbed into the *extrinsics* (mm-level bias); capture stills with a settle detector — offset drops to ~0.1 ms |
| 9 | Emitter dilemma: depth wants speckle, tags/VIO hate it | `emitter_on_off` alternation gives both; depth rate is *not* halved (only IR splits), verified two independent ways |
| 10 | Allan variance vs thermal modeling need **opposite** captures | Allan wants constant temperature, thermal wants a sweep — one dataset cannot serve both |
| 11 | USB2 negotiation was the *cable* | hub and port were innocent all along; USB-C cables are visually indistinguishable — check `bcdUSB`, then swap the cable first |
| 12 | Stream-pairing must use a pending queue | "drop if out of range" silently discards valid samples (gyro/accel interleave) |
| 13 | Range-along-ray vs z-depth confusion | stored ray length as depth once — a flat wall renders as a sphere (101 mm residual, right angles read 81.8°) |
| 14 | Headless WebGL capture with live animation | `requestAnimationFrame` keeps headless screenshots active — use the shipped `?static=1` mode for deterministic capture |

## Declarative verdict engine

![Depth-model verdict with online-calibration and SLAM-impact badges](docs/img/verdict_depth_badges.png)

```bash
python -m verdicts                      # terminal verdicts
python -m verdicts --md REPORT.md       # markdown report (committed in repo)
```

The 26 published checks live in
[`verdicts/rules_d435i.yaml`](verdicts/rules_d435i.yaml), each one
`{value expression, external reference, tolerance, action}` — executed by a
~200-line engine ([`verdicts/engine.py`](verdicts/engine.py)) that feeds the CLI
report, [`REPORT.md`](REPORT.md), and the GUI cards from one source of truth.
The same engine enforces completeness of the published artifact set. Adding a
device's verdict checks means writing rules, not forking verdict code.

The rules distinguish two independently captured baseline calibrations from
camera-chain values inherited into camera–IMU outputs; the independent pair
differs by 0.005 mm.

## The GUI

A WebGL2 point-cloud viewer with three tabs: **live cloud** (16-bit depth with
in-shader deprojection, or native xyz/intensity/RGB through VBOs), **calibration
results** (the verdict cards above, generated
from the actual yaml/json outputs — each card also carries two SLAM badges:
*can this quantity be calibrated online?* (extrinsic rotation / time offset / IMU bias
are standard online states in VINS-class systems; intrinsics and the depth chain are not)
and *how hard does it hit SLAM?*, tiered with the measured propagation number behind
each tier), and **calibration reference** (applicability/method/output for seven
reusable checks: four D435i and three LiDAR/rig references). The third tab keeps
this reusable method catalog separate from the 11 rig-specific results. Thermal
compensation can be applied to the live cloud with one checkbox.

![Calibration results with online-calibration and SLAM-impact badges](results/gui_slam_badges.png)

```bash
./view_pointcloud.sh fused                      # D435i + MID-360S, one frame/canvas
./view_pointcloud.sh mid360
./view_pointcloud.sh ros2 /your/pointcloud/topic
./view_pointcloud.sh ros2 auto                    # only when one candidate exists
./view_pointcloud.sh d435i --alt-emitter
./view_pointcloud.sh synthetic-points             # hardware-free native-stream test
```

`fused` opens one `camera_color_optical_frame` canvas and transforms both live
inputs into it. The documented rig's
[LiDAR–camera extrinsic](results/mid360s_d435i_extrinsic.local.json),
[time alignment](results/mid360s_d435i_timesync.json), and
[LiDAR–IMU geometry](results/mid360s_lidar_imu.json) load automatically;
`--extrinsic PATH` selects another rig's
camera transform. Livox `CustomMsg` scans use every point's `offset_time`, the
built-in IMU, and the known IMU lever arm for validated scan-end rotational
deskew. The
[generic LiDAR–camera workflow](docs/LIDAR_CAMERA_EXTRINSIC.md) covers capture,
solving, result conventions, import, and fused viewing.

The launcher opens `http://localhost:8080`, isolates ROS Jazzy from Conda, and
shuts both backends down when either live stream disconnects. Native ROS 2
clouds are rendered in their message frame as current-frame data.

## Reproducing on your own D435i

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Python ≥3.10; no ROS required)
2. Build the Kalibr docker image once: `docker build -t kalibr:noetic -f kalibr/Dockerfile_ros1_20_04 kalibr/`
   (clone [ethz-asl/kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr) into `kalibr/` first)
3. Print an AprilGrid, **measure** tag size and spacing with a ruler, edit the yaml
4. Capture → calibrate → *check the verdict rows before you trust anything*:
   the exact commands for every stage are at the end of [CALIBRATION.md](CALIBRATION.md)

Hardware note: results in this repo are from one D435i (fw 5.12.7.100) on USB 3.2.
Your unit's numbers **will** differ — that's the point of calibrating.

## Why publish error *impact*, not just error

[IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md](IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md) propagates every measured error into
mapping and localization terms (with a LiDAR/LiDAR-camera comparison column for a
Mid-360 rig), under one organizing principle: classify each error as zero-mean random /
constant systematic / **state-dependent systematic** — the third class is what breaks
maps (double walls from thermal depth-scale drift) and the second silently caps
map-based localization. It also ranks calibration priorities by measured impact.
If you only calibrate what your application actually feels, you save days.
